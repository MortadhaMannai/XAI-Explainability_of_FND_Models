# XAI: Explainability of FND Models

Author: Manai Mortadha

## Overview

This project focuses on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques applied to Financial Neural Decision (FND) models. The primary objective is to enhance transparency and interpretability in the decision-making process of FND models, providing insights into how these models arrive at specific conclusions or predictions in financial scenarios.

## Key Features

- Implementation of various XAI techniques.
- Analysis of interpretability methods for FND models.
- Visual representation of feature importance and model explanations.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets and data processing scripts.
- `models/`: Includes the FND models and XAI implementation scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks illustrating XAI techniques applied to FND models.
- `results/`: Stores generated output, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash

    ```

2. Set up the required environment by installing dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the notebooks or scripts in the respective folders.

## Usage

The notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` directory showcase the application of XAI techniques on FND models. Execute these notebooks to explore the explanations and interpretations generated.
